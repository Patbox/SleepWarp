# SleepWarp (Updated)
This mod will accelerate time while you sleep instead of skipping directly to day.
When installed on a multiplayer server, the acceleration speed will scale based on the number of players asleep.

The world will also be ticked at the same rate to simulate the passage of time (configurable)

SleepWarp can be used in either a single player, LAN, or dedicated server environment (not required on the client).
